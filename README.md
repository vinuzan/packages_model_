This calss will cover what is in the title.

## Definitions

## Libraries
These are built into python / standard in python.
You need to import them to use. 
These are still considered vanilla python

## Modules
These are internal, and ypu import them to use else  where in the code. We build lots of them in OOP but they can also be functional.

##Packages
These are external and need to be installed.
You can install them using PIP or using Pycharm. 

Pycharm, creates it's own virtual environment (VE) to avoid cross contamination.
